# Kattcmd tips

This is the manual page for the command `kattcmd tips`

## Usage

```
$ kattcmd tips
```

## Effect

The `tips` command is used to run you through user configuration. It
will ask you to enter default values for things like prefered template
and name (so that your name will show correctly in templates). This is
useful to run once you have installed `kattcmd` but you should only
need to run it once as it will walk you through setting some
configuration values that can make your life with `kattcmd` easier.
