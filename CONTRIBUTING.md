# How to contribute

Contributing can be done in many ways. For example looking at issues
and finding how to solve them, or look into documentation. If you want
to make instructive videos/webms then I will make sure to add
them/link them ASAP. If you have an idea for a feature then I suggest
you either contact me or file a pull request.

If you have an idea that you think fits with the project and is not
listed in the "Things that would be nice to have" list, then please
discuss it with me before creating a pull request and working on
it. Since there is no real quality assurance of this project I want to
make sure that at least the ideas within it are sound and fits the
theme of the application.

# Things that would be nice to have

Here is a list of things that would be cool to add to the
project. Either through the plugin system or to the core program.


### Templates and runners for different programming languages

For competitive programming I only use C++ and python, but I know a
lot of people use Java and because Kattis also supports a ton of
different languages it would be nice to support a wide array of
languages.


### User Guide

I find that the best projects are also the most user friendly and
creating a user guide with visual media is something I think would be
very useful. This section is more aimed at the end-user and not the
developers. This would include things like: example usages,
webms/videos of typical usage and tutorial-style guides.


### Complex testing logic

Some problems have a more complex testing logic and they require some
form of program to validate. This is an area in which it would be nice
to allow for some cool form of validation where you have some standard
types of validation or have some Domain Specific Language where you
describe the validation. An example of a standard validation would be
`set`, the order of the items are not relevant, or `set-lines`, each
line in the output has to match by set equality.

Most importantly for complex testing logic is that it should be possible for
pull requests to add solutions to new problems so they appear automatically into
the tool.
